            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </note>
                  <hi>Iustice</hi> is a vertue, gathered by lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ge space, geuing euery one hys owne, mindyng in all things, the common profite of our <hi>Countrey,</hi> whereunto man is moste bounde, &amp; oweth hys full obedience. The auncient Ciuilians saye, <hi>Iustice</hi> is a will perpetuall and constante, which geeueth to euerye man hys ryghte. In that it is named constante, it impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Fortitude: In discerning what is right or wronge, Prudence is required. And to proporcion the sentence or iudgement in an equalitie, belongeth to Temperance. All these together conglutinate and effectually executed, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a perfecte definition of Iustice.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Offic. lib.</hi> 1.</note> And Tully differethe not moche from the same definition of Iustice, where hee saiethe, it is alwayes occupied, eyther in preseruinge the felowship of men, geeuing vnto euery bodie that which is hys owne,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Iustice.</hi>
                  </note> or keping a faythfulnes in contractes. He saieth also, that the foundacion of perpetual prayse and renome, is Iustice, without the which nothing may bee commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable: whiche sentence is verefied by daily experience. For be a man neuer so gentle, bounteous, valiante, or liberal, bee hee neuer so wise, familiar, or courtaise, yf hee bee once sene to exercise Iniustice, or to do wrong, it is then well noted, and often remembred: yea, all vertues (where Iusti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce faileth) lacke theire commendation. I harde of late, as I traueled by the waye, a gentelman praysed for sundry ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tues which were in hym, as that he was gentle and meke, pleasaunt and faire in wordes, wise, wel learned, modeste, and sobre: but I harde no remembrance made of hys Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6591:10"/>
For immediately one present in the company repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hym to be an vsurer, a person deceiptfull, couetous, an oppressor of the poore, and no keper of hospitalitye, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge fower or fiue fermes in hys handes and more, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee was a decayer of houses of husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>derie, a rerer of retes, &amp; a cruel taker of fynes.

               <p>Finally to bee shorte, that Manlynes is worthie to bee praysed, which woorketh by the strength of the mynde, &amp; not of the bodie: and yet not to faynte in corage, but to be constante, not fearing the roughe stormes of any aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, neyther the sharpe brontes of the warres, or the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of bitter death.</p>

               <p>He that practiseth this vertue is called a temperat man, and he that doth the contrary thereto, is named intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:

betwene whome and a person incontinent, <hi>Aristotle</hi> maketh this diuersitie, that he is intemperate, whiche by hys own election is ledde, supposing the pleasure that ys present, shoulde alway be folowed: But the person incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent supposeth not so, and yet he notwythstandynge, doth folow it.</p>
               <p>The temperate man delyteth in nothynge contrarye to reason, and will do nothing for bodely pleasure, whyche shall stande agaynst reason. <hi>Temperance,</hi> as a sadde and discrete matrone and reuerent gouernesse, awayteth dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, that in no wise incontinencie or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cupisence haue any preheminence in the soule of man. Therefore as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance (being a vice moste vnpure, stynkynge and filthie) is of all estates and degrees, and in all ages, to be eschued, auoyded, and abhorred: So <hi>Temperance,</hi> at all tymes and in all thynges, is to be folowed, embraced, and loued, whych will cause vs to do nothyng for bodely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that shalbe hurtfull or contrary to the health.
